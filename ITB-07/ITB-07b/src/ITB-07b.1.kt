    //Input:
    // — Read the amount iterations the user wants to do.
    // — Each iteration contains:
    //   — A line with the size of the array of shoes.
    //   — Another line of K numbers representing the shoes sizes (All of them between 8 and 60)
    //   — Lastly, a number M, representing the user shoe size.
//Output:
    // — Depending on the user input:
    //   — Print "SI" if there is a shoe size in the array that fits well for the user's.
    //     (Only when it is either equal to M, one less or one more)
    //
    //   — Print "NO" if there is no shoe that meets those requirements.
